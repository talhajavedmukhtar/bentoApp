# Bento Packing Visualization
Algorithm for fitting items into a bento box.

It is important to note that this is an [NP-Hard problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness). However, this algorithm was created for a Figma plugin, and the algorithm produces results decently fast for the normal inputs a user of said plugin would enter.
